# Bookshelf

This app is a simple bookshelf with a Flask backend and will have a React frontend. This is currently being built on **Replit** so the backend is connected to the Replit Postgres database. Currently Evolving. 

When it is deployed, it would most likely be deployed on Replit's native deployments
